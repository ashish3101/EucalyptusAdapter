# EucalyptusAdapter

Virtual labs are the collection of web-applications which interact with browser on one end and with set of virtual lab services at other end. At present, these virtual labs are
deployed on physical servers. But, availability, scalability, and robustness becomes an issue in long run. Hence, the better
option is to move these labs to a cloud infrastructure. This project outlines an attempt by the institution, to deploy an
Infrastructure as a Service cloud to enhance the student learning experience. As part of this, we introduce a python
API that simplifies the deployment of Virtual Labs on cloud infrastructures. We describe the features and functionality of
API, and how this API can be used to set up experiments on academic clouds such as OpenStack, Eucalyptus.
